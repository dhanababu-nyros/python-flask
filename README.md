    ~ What is Python-Flask?

      A SQLite and Flask powered twitter clone

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. edit the configuration in the main.py file or
         export an MAIN_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. fire up a python shell and run this:

         >>> from main import init_db; init_db()

      3. now you can run the main.py file with your
         python interpreter and the application will
         greet you on http://localhost:5000/

    ~ Installation
